### How would you test the word count program? What kind of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?


A. Testing -
    - short input (nothing)
    - long input (larger than memory?)
    - definition of 'word' (punctuation is part of a word right now)


B. Bugs
    - Really long input would probably create memory issues?
    - Systems with different newlines

C. Not bugs? Needs tests!
    - Non letter ascii symbols probably will be ok, system bell?
    - getchar() limitations?
